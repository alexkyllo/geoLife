## Branch: Data
Only the generated data is stored here.

When using Erobar: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdBo42wDw10uZL5OcpsA4e7ebX15rm9N3sMZzGTjF54/edit 

Ensure that the data repo is in /UWNETID/data 

### 1.1 Mission 
Data pre-processing to detect anomoulous users <br>
Paper: https://doi.org/10.1145/3380970

### 1.2 Approach
1. Heatmaps for each user
2. Creates keras layers of image representation of heatmaps
3. Incorporate Training Data and Verfification set
4. Train LSTM Model

### 1.3 Results
Todo, include relavent graph and information.

Goal: public dataset when we have some results and data visualization
